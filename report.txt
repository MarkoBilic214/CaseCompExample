Details of recommendation system.

Users:
There are hard-coded users in 'src/assets/users/usersList.json' that each have rated movies. Users' rated movies are somewhat created with a 
pattern based on genre. (a users likes a certain genre of movies, rating the ones that fall in the genre highly and others lowly)


Recommendation calculations:
Users similarities are calculated using the pearson correlation, and the estimated rating for a user that hasn't rated a movie is calculated
using the weighted sum method.

Because the database of movies is so large and the hard coded users only have so many rated movies, there are many movies that do not suggest
other movies when rated.


Process when a movie is rated:
When a movie is rated the system iterates through each user. It calculates the similarity between the guest and the user. If the similarity
is above 0.5 then it will add all the movies that the guest hasn't rated to a candidate movies list. After all the similarities have been 
calculated, the system iterates through the list of candidate movies (unique item list), and calculates the estimated score for the guest.
If the estimated score is above a 2, then it is added to the recommendation list which is then displayed. This entire process is done each 
time the guest rates a movie.
